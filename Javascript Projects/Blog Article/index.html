      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h6>The 2019 Lexus LC 500 Coupe was launched as a successor to the manufacturer's halo car the LFA. But not following the same footsteps and ultimately trying to turn out to be one of the biggest names in the supercar industry. The 2019 Lexus LC 500 Coupe took altogether a different approach to look up to the automobile industry. This smart boy since then intimately ruled the market and had always been on the top of its sales chart. It is not the best GT car in the automobile industry but the better part is that it does not even pretend to be one. Instead, the 2019 Lexus LC 500 Coupe has its character and brings all the top class engineering which is totally in favour of this Japanese Manufacturer.</h6>

      <h6>Concept cars have all the audacity to steal the attention of the crowd with their sleek designs and crease through the exterior design. Still very few of them had managed to get to the factory line manufacturing and see the sunshine. This isn't the case when it comes to the Japanese manufacturer Lexus which had ultimately made its name under the most reliable automobiles in the industry. The 2019 Lexus LC 500 Coupe somehow made it to the streets and the immense love people had shown towards it is commendable. It stands against its competitors like the Mercedes Benz AMG E 53 Coupe, and the Jaguar F Type R Dynamic Coupe, and the Nissan GTR Premium which are equally popular as well.</h6>
      <h2 style="margin:20px">What Powers the 2019 Lexus LC 500 Coupe?</h2>
      <h6>The model is powered by a 5.0L Premium Unleaded V8 Engine. This engine is mated with a 10-Speed Automatic transmission and rear-wheel-drive setup that is being developed in house by Lexus itself. This extreme beast turns the show in its favour by producing 471hp@7,100rpm of horsepower and 398lb-ft@4,800rpm of torque in a go.</h6>
